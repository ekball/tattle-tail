        Start off in a low distraction environment. We are NOT going to use a verbal cue initially.
              
        Put a smelly treat in the palm of your hand and hold in place with your thumb.

        Allow dog to sniff the treat, but do not give it to them.

        Move the lure/treat slowly over the dog’s head, high enough that he must crane his neck back to con,nue targe,ng, but not so high that he jumps to target.

        Move the lure slightly backward over the dog while maintaining the same height.

        Now wait!

        If the dog gets up or jumps, start over.

        When the dog is signg, mark the behavior and give the reward.

        Repeat this 4 - 6 times and each time, the dog should sit with less and less effort from you.

      Another way to think about is that there is a string attached from your middle finger to the dog’s nose. 
      As you bring your hand up in front of the dog, their head will follow up while their butt hits the ground.
