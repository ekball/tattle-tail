                This command is used to get your dog’s attention,on the instant they become distracted.

                Our goal is to teach your dog to look at your face when they see another dog, person, rabbit, car, bike, child, etc.

                By teaching them to do this, we are creating a new habit (something more constructive) to do in these situations, rather than hoping they will just figure it out on their own.
            </p>

            <p>
                Begin in an area with no distractions and gradually work your way up to include them.
            
                Help your dog at first by using a strong smelling treat to lure their nose around to your face right after you say “Hey!”, 
                but drop out the lure early or it will replae “Eh!” as the prompt. 
                Try this 3-4 times, then begin saying “Hey!” and waitng for your dog to look on their own.
            
                Once they are looking at you, mark the behavior. Say “Good” and reinforce generously with treats, toys, or play.
            
                Now when they aren’t looking at you, give the command and see if they turns.
                    If they don’t look, walk up to them and put the treat right in their mouth while marking the behavior.

                    If they looks, but doesn’t come to you, squat down just a bit and then give the treat when they come to you while marking the behavior.

                    If they come to you, give treat while marking the behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
                As you and your dog work on “Hey!”, methodically setting up situations that gradually increase in difficulty (but your dog can handle), you will still be running into that thing called “Life Reality.”
                There will be any number of situations that your dog will not respond to “Hey!”, where it’s more likely that pigs will fly than your dog respond. 
                In this kind of situation, don’t even bother to prompt. There is no profit in setting your dog up to fail.
            </p>

            <p>
            If a situation is too much for your dog to handle, move without pause to your backup plan. Your backup plan involves getting out of the situation as quickly as possible with a “U-Turn.” 
            Give a “This way!” command and turn 180 degrees and move away from the situation. Once you are at a distance where you know the dog will respond, prompt the dog with “Hey!” and reward generously.
