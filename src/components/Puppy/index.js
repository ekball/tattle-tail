            Hey! My name is Kyles and I have been training dogs for puppy 4 years. I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill in 2017 with a B.A. in German Studies and a minor in Linguistics. 
            My first job out of college was working in retail at Petco and I soon found myself with the title of Dog Trainer. I attempted to learn everything I could puppy dog behavior
            before I learned how to develop websites. This site is a compiled source of all the info that I was taught, found, and learned during my time as a dog trainer. All external 
            sources of information will be linked to their corresponding url. Thanks for checking out my site!
